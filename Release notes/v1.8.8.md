## Improvements

- Updated translations.  
- Improved app performance when a tree view (e.g. File explorer) is displaying a large number of items.
- Made minor improvements to app load time.  
- Updated app settings to reflect changes to the Commercial license.  
- List auto-numbering now preserves custom starting numbers.  
- Obsidian Sync: Added a warning before connecting to a remote vault if the vault is already managed by a third-party sync service that could cause conflicts.  
- When "Smart indent lists" is disabled, the editor no longer automatically renumbers lists.  

## No longer broken  

- Fixed regression causing metadata to take significantly longer to load and save on newer installers.  
- Fixed bug where `- - -` did not render correctly.  
- Fixed issue preventing Obsidian from opening files with corrupted fold information.  
- Fixed width of tables inside embedded notes.  
- Fixed indentation of checklist items inside loose lists.  
- Fixed bug where clicking inside a PDF view did not focus the view.  
- Fixed issue where folding a list item in reading mode did not always persist when switching to edit mode.  
- Fixed bug where pressing `Down Arrow` while the inline title was focused did not move focus to the editor if properties were hidden.  
- Creating a new vault via the "Quick start" button now opens `welcome.md`.
