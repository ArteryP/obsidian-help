When you create a [[Local and remote vaults|remote vault]] through [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] your data is encrypted and stored on one of Obsidian's specific regional Sync servers.

This guide explains how to migrate your Sync vault to the latest encryption, or move your vault to a different regional server.

> [!danger] Migrations are destructive
> 
> **Always [[Back up your Obsidian files|backup]] your vault before proceeding with a migration.**
> 
> When you migrate a remote vault to a different region or upgrade to the latest encryption, your data will be replaced. This means:
> 
> 1. Remote data will be removed from Obsidian servers, and vault data will be re-uploaded in its place.
> 2. All [[Version history|version history]] for the vault will be lost.

## Upgrade Sync encryption

Obsidian occasionally upgrades Sync encryption to maintain the highest [[Obsidian Sync/Security and privacy|security]] standards.

If an encryption upgrade is available you will see an option titled **Upgrade vault encryption** in Obsidian Settings â†’ Sync.

Once you re-upload your data with the new encryption, all other devices will need to re-connect to the new Sync vault. Note that all devices must be using an Obsidian app version that supports the Sync encryption you are migrating to.

| Sync version | Minimum app version |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| 2025-01-15   | 1.7.0               |
| 2020-12-07   | 0.9.21              |

## Change Sync region

To change your remote vault's region, you will need to perform the following steps in order. Please make a [[Back up your Obsidian files|backup]] of your data first.

![[Set up Obsidian Sync#Disconnect from a remote vault]]

If you are on the [[Plans and storage limits|Standard Plan]], you will also need to [[#Delete a remote vault|delete your remote vault]] before proceeding.

![[Set up Obsidian Sync#Create a new remote vault]]
![[Set up Obsidian Sync#Connect to a remote vault]]

Additionally, you can [[#Delete a remote vault|delete your old remote vault]] once you have confirmed transition to your new remote vault and its region.
