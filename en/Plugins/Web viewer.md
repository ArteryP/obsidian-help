Web viewer lets you open external links within Obsidian. This simplifies reading linked content without leaving the app and makes multitasking on web research projects easier.

External links open as a [[Tabs|tab]] which you can rearrange, split, and open in a [[pop-out windows|pop-out window]]. Any web page cards embedded in [[canvas]] files can be opened as web viewer tabs.
