Obsidian allows you to easily import [Textbundle](https://textbundle.org/) files using the official [[Importer|Importer plugin]]. Textbundle is a file format that bundles the Markdown text and all referenced images into a single file.

If you are importing notes from a specific app, you may want to first review the list of apps supported by [[Importer|Importer plugin]] to check if there is a specific converter that will better preserve the data you are migrating.
